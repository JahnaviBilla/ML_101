Linear Regression with Gradient Descent - A Python Implementation

This code implements a linear regression model with gradient descent for training. It is designed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

Key Features:

Linear Regression with Gradient Descent: The code utilizes gradient descent to optimize the model's weights (coefficients) and bias, minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted and actual values.
Class-Based Structure: The code is organized into a linear_regression class, promoting modularity and reusability.
Clear Method Definitions: Each class method has a well-defined purpose, making the code easier to follow and maintain.
Installation:

This code requires the numpy library. 

Explanation of the Code:

linear_regression Class:
__init__(): Initializes the class with learning rate and number of iterations.
fit(): Trains the model by iteratively updating weights and bias using gradient descent.
update_weights(): Performs gradient descent to update weights and bias.
predict(): Predicts Y values for new input X.
print_weights(): Prints the learned weights and bias.
return_parameters(): Returns the learned weights and bias as a tuple.

Additional Notes:

This is a basic implementation for educational purposes. Consider evaluating performance metrics like MSE or R-squared on unseen data for a more comprehensive evaluation.
You may need to adjust the learning rate and number of iterations based on your dataset and desired accuracy.
Explore advanced techniques like normalization or regularization for improved performance on real-world datasets.
